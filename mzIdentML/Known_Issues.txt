The following is a list of known issues with Search2mzIdentML:

-Format.findAccession(name) is slow. Using a hash might speed it up, but I thought nokogiri was supposed to do it fast?
-Format.findAccession(name) won't find the id if the name is precisely correct. This is a problem because some of the mzIdentML terms are not the same as the pepXML terms.
-Format.conformScoreName(name, engine) currently covers only three search engine names.
-PepXML.proteins doesn't return the same number of proteins that Mascot shows in its mzid file. Unsure of reason. Not sure if alternative_proteins should be included.
-PepXML.peptides doesn't return the same number of peptides that Mascot shows in its mzid file. Unsure of reason. May be redundant with findAllPepLocations.
-PepXML.results can't be guarenteed to return the correct spectrum indices. Currently bases indices off of search hits. Only way to make sure it's correct is to base it off of the mgf (Or whatever it is), but that would mean having yet another file as input and would also slow the program down.
-PepXML.findAllPepLocations doesn't completely match Mascot's mzid file. Mascot's mzid file sometimes uses the alternative protein instead. Don't know why.
-PepXML.proteinID(protein) doesn't currently work pepXML files that used indices for protein IDs. May be other forms of protein IDs to handle that I haven't seen.
-Search2mzIdentML currently does a strict conversion, meaning it has no options and only writes to the mzIdentML file that which is required. Might be able to expand its abilities, but I'm not considering it until I can even get this working correctly.
