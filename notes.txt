1. INSTALLING TPP

--------
#If admin permission is needed, enter the command: sudo bash
cd /usr/local/src/
svn co https://sashimi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/sashimi/tags/release_4-3-1/trans_proteomic_pipeline/
cd trans_proteomic_pipeline/installer_linux/
sh ./install-prerequisites-ubuntu-9_04.sh

cd ../src/
make
make install
--------

This version of TPP comes with an outdated X! Tandem, so I downloaded the recent one from their web site. g++ complains at it though, so I had to add "#include <stdint.h>" to saxhandler.h. It also complains at several files, so I had to add "#include <string.h>" to those files. Also, X! Tandem automatically adds the exact date to the name of each output file, making it more difficult for automation. I fixed this by commenting out line 914 of tandem-linux-10-01-01-4/src/mreport.cpp and re-executing make.


2. CHILD PROCESSES

Since the pipeline relies on several programs, I chose to execute those programs by using the kernel::fork method. Handing these processes off to be handled by the computer's scheduler makes for more efficient use of time, and is very helpful when running multiple search engines. There are different ways to do this in Ruby, but I chose the fork method because you can choose to wait by calling Process.wait, or not call it and go on. In order to wait for several processes to finish, such as in the search class, I created a method to runs a while loop calling Process.wait. This way, it will keep waiting until all child processes have finished, throw an exception when there are none to wait on but be caught be an exception handler.


3. HARDKLOR

Hardklor's output is in a unique format and is thus cannot be used as input to the search engines. Can it be converted to an appropriate format?


4. SELECTING AN ENZYME

The search engines use different ways of selecting an enzyme in the command line. To handle this, I chose to have the name of the enzyme be the input to the pipeline, while nokogiri is parses an xml file to obtain the correct input for the search engine. X! Tandem didn't have such an xml file, so I made it myself.


5. DECOY DATABASES

I created a class to select and reverse a database to be used in decoy searches. The code to format the output may not be necessary. formatdb needs to be called to convert a database into the correct format for OMSSA, both on the normal and reversed databases. I have not at this time automated the database reversal.


6. INSTALLING FROM JUST THE PIPELINE SOURCE CODE

As of 4 June 2010:
cd pipeline/
sudo aptitude install ruby1.9.1-full
sudo aptitude install rubygems1.9.1
git clone http://github.com/jtprince/ms-msrun.git
*Crazy stuff happened
gem install builder
git clone http://github.com/jtprince/ms-error_rate.git
sudo aptitude install wine
install ReAdW.exe and get XCalibur's Xrawfile2.dll, fileio.dll, fregistry.dll into the same folder as ReAdW.exe, along with zlib1.dll
install hardklor
install X! Tandem. May need to add "#include <stdint.h>" to saxhandler.h. Make correction as noted in note 7.
install OMSSA
install Tide from http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/tide/
download search engine databases
sudo apt-get install blast2. This is to use formatdb on the search engine databases to format them for OMSSA.


7. MODIFIED X! TANDEM

For some reason, X! Tandem automatically renamed the output files to include the date and time. This complicated automation, so I edited the source code to not add the date and time by commenting out line 914 of tandem-linux-10-01-01-4/src/mreport.cpp.


8. POSSIBLE NAMES

ProjectZero: Because Zero kicks butt, and so should this. Megaman Zero reference.
WarpPipe: Because, well, both pipeline and warp pipe have the word pipe in it. Super Mario reference.
JPipe: Because my name starts with J, and so does John's. There's gotta be at least one narcissistic name, right?
KatamariShiteki (Clod Identification) or KatamariBunkai (Clod Analysis): Because it's a wad of other programs. Katamari Damacy reference.
SmartPipe: Because Smartball can whiz back and forth right through pipes. Smartball reference.
MasterPipe: Zelda reference.
PeptideBaton: Like a music conductor, the user simply waves his baton (Enters a command) and the the orchestra (Program) plays the parts of the song (Runs the different programs). Windwaker reference.
